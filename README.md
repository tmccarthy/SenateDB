# SenateDB

A tool for collating and analysing the raw data about Australian Senate elections made available on the 
Australian Electoral Commission's website. This is essentially a slightly more ambitious rewrite of my 
other project at [HypotheticalSenate](https://github.com/tmccarthy/HypotheticalSenate). The initial focus
will be analysing the 2016 election.
